# Task Update: phase4_task1_documentation_suite

**Status**: completed
**Worker**: worker-2
**Timestamp**: 2025-11-14 10:18:11Z

## Progress
- Refreshed README.md with feature overview, prerequisites, install flow, quick start, command summary, configuration breakdown, limitations, troubleshooting, and cross-links to the new docs
- Authored ARCHITECTURE.md describing each layer (CLI, Services, Agents, Tools, Persistence), data flows, validation loop behavior, and extensibility points grounded in the current code
- Added DEVELOPMENT.md covering environment setup, dependency installation (pip/uv), lint/format/type/test commands, LangGraph smoke test instructions, and guidance for extending commands/services/nodes/tools
- Added USAGE_GUIDE.md with task-oriented walkthroughs, CLI flag table, configuration tips, and troubleshooting steps for typical Hermes workflows

## Results (if completed)
- Output location: README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, USAGE_GUIDE.md at repo root
- Key findings: Documented current limitations (browser/container clients placeholders, validator loop behavior) so expectations match the implementation; ensured every section references actual files/commands
- Additional notes: Docs cross-link to each other per phase 4 spec

## Blockers (if any)
- None

## Next Steps (if in progress)
- N/A
